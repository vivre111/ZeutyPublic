# How to Run and Build Your First React Native Apps

## For Windows Users

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your Windows system. If not, you can follow [these instructions](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-yarn) to install Yarn on Windows.

### Getting Started

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React Native project.

3. Use Yarn to create a new Expo project. Replace `AwesomeProject` with your desired project name:
    ```bash
    yarn create expo-app AwesomeProject
    ```

4. Move into your newly created project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AwesomeProject
    ```

5. Start the Expo development server:
    ```bash
    yarn expo start
    ```

6. Follow the instructions in your terminal to run the app on an emulator or physical device.

Happy coding! 

In your next step, make sure you have an IDE (VS Code recommended).
